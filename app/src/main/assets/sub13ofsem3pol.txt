        <b>Suggested Student Exercises:</b>\n
1. Discussion of readings and Indian examples.\n
2. Groups of students to collect examples of and discuss various sample based studies across many fields: e.g. consumer behaviour, unemployment rates, educational standards, elections, medicinal trials etc.\n
3. Non-random sampling: The students have to identify one group of people or behaviour that is unique or rare and for which snowball sampling might be needed. They have to identify how they might make the initial contact with this group to start snowball rolling.\n
4. Give the students the electoral list of an area in Delhi (http://ceodelhi.gov.in). The students have to draw a random sample of n number of respondents.\n
5. For this activity, working with a partner will be helpful. The class should first decide on a topic of interest. Then each pair should construct a five-item self report questionnaire.\n
Of the five items, there should be at least one nominal response, one ordinal response and one interval. After the common questionnaire is constructed putting together the questions from everyone, working in pairs, the questionnaire should be administered on 10 different individuals.\n
6. Give the students a questionnaire from any public opinion survey and ask them to identify the type of variables.
